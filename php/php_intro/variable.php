< ?php 
  echo "Hi";
  // Variables : 
    // Container which store value
    // memory loaction wher the actula value is stored.
    php = loosely typed language
    Dont need to specify the type before using the variable.

    Why we need data type?

    Which type of data we want to store = 

    Data in the world which the computer need to process that was not on one kind = Data Type?
    {
        Integer = int
        Decimal number(Float Double)
        Char
        String
        // Void
    }
      = Structure 4 = 100
      = Size different = 2 bytes = 16 bit
      = Different operations = defines the possible operration on that data.
      = It define its scope (availablity).


    array(1,2,3) =>  
    //php 7> option php stronged /loosely
    $x= (int) 123; 

    int x[3] = [1,2,3];
      [ 0001 0010 0011 ] =>
      
      0 000000000000001 = 1
      1 000000000000001 = -1
    x= x+2;

    printf("%d",x);

    +1 -1 

    Data representation.

script = program
= show the starting point = Php compiler know now that php code is started form here





int x = 10;

$x = 10;
